# Vintage Character-Display

Simulates the video display from the ZX81/TS1000 in-browser

It's a 32x24 character CRT television screen that can display 64 8x8 characters (128 if you consider the inverted characters)

At the moment it doesn't let you type or refresh, it just displays the character set.

A demo is available on [my personal site](http://busterdash.me/vcd)
